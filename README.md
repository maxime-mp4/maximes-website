# maxime-mp4's website

this project is simply a personnal website that i'm creating for now. i don't know if this will be finished one day, but it'll prolly be the case soon (in maybe, 2 or 3 months)

used : tailwindcss, vuejs and classic html obviously

may change the readme, with a better design and a better presentation.

for any contact (a potential feedback, or some suggestions) please contact me below : @maxime.arbb on discord
